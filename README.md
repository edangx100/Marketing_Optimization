## Executive Overview

This analysis applies a data-driven strategy to optimize revenue from direct marketing campaigns. Leveraging a dataset of 1,615 bank clients, **6 models** were trained and applied to identify high-propensity targets and assign optimal offers.

The solution targets the top 15% of clients with personalized offers, achieving an expected revenue of **$691.39** from 96 targeted clients. All 96 clients (100.0% of targets) are assigned Consumer Loan offers due to higher expected revenue per client.

## Dataset Preparation
Data from the `soc_dem`, `products`, `inflow`, and `sales` spreadsheets were merged to create a consolidated dataset of 1,615 bank clients for analysis.

The dataset was split into a training set (60%, 969 clients) and a test set (40%, 646 clients) for targeting evaluation. The top 15% of clients from the test set (96 individuals) were selected for targeting.

## Methodology: 6-Stage Targeting Strategy

| Stage                            | Model(s) used                                                                     | Output                                                                                                        |

## Key Results

### Model Performance
Six machine learning models were developed to support marketing optimization across three financial products:
#### üìä Revenue Regression Models
- Consumer Loan (`Revenue_CL`)
- Credit Card (`Revenue_CC`)
- Mutual Fund (`Revenue_MF`)
#### üõçÔ∏è Sales Classification Models
- Consumer Loan (`Sale_CL`)
- Credit Card (`Sale_CC`)
- Mutual Fund (`Sale_MF`)

| Product | Sales Model F1 | Revenue Model RMSE |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Consumer Loan | 0.566 | 11.012 |
| Credit Card | 0.442 | 6.908 |
| Mutual Fund | 0.340 | 7.042 |

### Propensity Analysis by Product

**Consumer Loan:**
  - **Average Propensity**: 33.2% across all clients
  - **Targeting Strategy**: 96 clients (100.0% of targets) assigned CL offers

**Credit Card:**
  - **Average Propensity**: 11.4% across all clients
  - **Targeting Strategy**: 0 clients assigned CC offers

**Mutual Fund:**
  - **Average Propensity**: 8.0% across all clients
  - **Targeting Strategy**: 0 clients assigned MF offers (lower expected value)

### Optimal Offer Assignment Strategy

**Client Targeting Decision Logic:**
- **Consumer Loans**: Assigned to clients with highest CL expected value (96 clients)
- **Credit Cards**: Not assigned due to lower expected revenue per client
- **Mutual Funds**: Not assigned due to lower expected revenue per client

**Expected Revenue by Strategy:**
- **Total Expected Revenue**: $691.39 from 96 targeted clients
- **Average Expected Revenue per Client**: $2.78
- **Lift vs Baseline Targeting**: 159.0%
- **Revenue Distribution**: CL (100.0%), CC (0.0%), MF (0.0%)


## Recommendations
1. **Deploy Targeting Strategy**: Implement the 96-client targeting list ([targeted_clients.csv](./targeted_clients.csv)) for next campaign
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track actual vs. expected revenue for model validation
3. **Iterate Models**: Retrain with new campaign results for continuous improvement
