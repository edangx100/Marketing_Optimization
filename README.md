## ðŸ“‹ **Executive Overview**

This analysis applies a data-driven strategy to optimize revenue from direct marketing campaigns. Leveraging a dataset of 1,615 bank clients, **6 models** were trained and applied to identify high-propensity targets and assign optimal offers.

The solution targets the top 15% of clients with personalized offers, achieving an estimated revenue of **$599.22** from 96 targeted clients. 89 clients (92.7%) are assigned Consumer Loan offers, 7 clients (7.3%) are assigned Credit Card offers.

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset Preparation**
Data from the `soc_dem`, `products`, `inflow`, and `sales` spreadsheets were merged to create a consolidated dataset of 1,615 bank clients for analysis.

The dataset was split into a training set (60%, 969 clients) and a test set (40%, 646 clients) for targeting evaluation. The top 15% of clients from the test set (96 individuals) were selected for targeting.

## ðŸ”¬ **Methodology: 6-Stage Targeting Strategy**

| Stage                            | Model(s) used                                                                     | Output                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Score purchase propensity** | 3 **binary classifiers**<br> â€¢ `Sale_CL_model`: Predicts Consumer Loan purchase probability <br> â€¢ `Sale_CC_model`: Predicts Credit Card purchase probability <br> â€¢ `Sale_MF_model`: Predicts Mutual Fund purchase probability | For every client *i* a calibrated probability pÌ‚<sub>ip</sub> (e.g. "Jane has a **31 %** chance of taking a consumer loan").    |
| **2. Score conditional revenue** | 3 **regressors**<br> â€¢ `Rev_CL_model`: Predicts revenue if Consumer Loan sale occurs<br> â€¢ `Rev_CC_model`: Predicts revenue if Credit Card sale occurs <br> â€¢ `Rev_MF_model`: Predicts revenue if Mutual Fund sale occurs           | For the same client *i* a point estimate of revenue **if** the sale occurs, rÌ‚<sub>ip</sub> (e.g. "expected loan margin \$135"). |
| **3. Combine to expected value** | â€”                                                                    | EV<sub>ip</sub> = pÌ‚<sub>ip</sub> Ã— rÌ‚<sub>ip</sub> for each product *p*                                                |
| **4. Pick the best offer**       | â€”                                                                        | `best_offer_i` = argmax<sub>p</sub> EV<sub>ip</sub> <br>`best_EV_i` = max<sub>p</sub> EV<sub>ip</sub> <br>One optimal offer per client with expected value justification                         |
| **5. Build the final list**      | â€”                                                                   | Rank clients by `best_EV_i`, slice the top 15 %.                                                                               |
| **6. Revenue forecast / lift**   | â€”                                                                           | Sum of `best_EV_i` in the list                                                                                                 |


## ðŸ“ˆ **Key Results**

### Model Performance
Six machine learning models using XGBoost were trained to support marketing optimization across three financial products:
#### Revenue Regression Models
- Consumer Loan (`Revenue_CL`)
- Credit Card (`Revenue_CC`)
- Mutual Fund (`Revenue_MF`)
#### Sales Classification Models
- Consumer Loan (`Sale_CL`)
- Credit Card (`Sale_CC`)
- Mutual Fund (`Sale_MF`)

| Product | Sales Model F1 | Revenue Model RMSE |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Consumer Loan | 0.615 | 7.776 |
| Credit Card | 0.615 | 5.506 |
| Mutual Fund | 0.444 | 4.248 |

### Propensity Analysis by Product

**Consumer Loan:**
  - **Average Propensity**: 45.3% across all clients
  - **Targeting Strategy**: 89 clients (92.7% of targets) assigned

**Credit Card:**
  - **Average Propensity**: 44.3% across all clients
  - **Targeting Strategy**: 7 clients (7.3% of targets) assigned

**Mutual Fund:**

## ðŸ’¡ **Recommendations**
1. **Deploy Targeting Strategy**: Implement the 96-client targeting list ([targeted_clients.csv](./targeted_clients.csv)) for next campaign
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track actual vs. estimated revenue for model validation
3. **Iterate Models**: Retrain with new campaign results for continuous improvement
